# square-theme
An experimental theme for the Mozilla WebThings Gateway that removes the octopus design.

In Firefox you have to set a flag to be able to see everything:

visit about:config in your Firefox browser. Then, search for:

layout.css.shadow-parts.enabled

And set it to true by double clicking on it.
